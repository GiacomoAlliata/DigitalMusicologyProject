# Milestone 1 - Project Proposal

For our project, we want to study the structure of pop/rock songs and its evolution over time.
Specifically we want to characterize the different parts of a song (typically the verses and the chorus). 
The verse-chorus structure is fairly common in these types of popular music and we want to find out what differentiates them 
and make it fairly easy to recognize a chorus when you hear it. The time dimension is also important to us as we want to analyze 
pop and rock songs over a few decades and hopefully find an evolution in the song structure and different parts characteristics.

Of course there are some obvious answers here such as a chorus usually being repeated nearly identical several times in a piece or 
having other singing voices joining the main one. However we believe there are also other differences more on a technical level 
such as chords distribution, the use of specific words (or grammatical categories) and a change in the rhythm.

In practice we will compare musical features and lyrics in the different parts of a song in order to find defining characteristics. 
The musical features we can analyze mainly depend on the data we have but we will mainly focus on chords. Lyrics will also be compared. 
To do so we will rely on statistics and distributions of these features on the different parts. 

In terms of dataset, a starting point could be the Rolling Stone corpus but a larger dataset such as https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/ 
could also be used.
